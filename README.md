[Backend Repo](https://github.com/tsukudabuddha/stock-backend/blob/main/README.md)

## TODO's
* Validate form properly
* Handle loading and error states
* Style the Input form

## Getting Started
* Install Node -- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

    * If this fails, try installing the dependcies using `npm install` or troubleshoot

Great! The app should be running
